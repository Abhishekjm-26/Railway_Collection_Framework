Railway department maintain 3 informationâ€™s
1. Reservation (confirmed) - C no. of tickets
2. RAC - Reservation against cancellation - R no. of tickets
3. Waiting List - W no. of tickets.
All passengers expect their reservation is going to be confirmed.
If C no. tickets already confirmed, their reservation will be treated as RAC.
If R no. tickets already confirmed, their reservation will be listed under waiting
list.
Any passenger under any of these 3 lists, can cancel the ticket.
If cancellation is done in confirmed list, then one passenger info from RAC, is
moved to Confirmed list and one passenger info from waiting list is moved to
RAC
If cancellation is done in RAC, then one passenger info from Waiting list is
moved to RAC list
